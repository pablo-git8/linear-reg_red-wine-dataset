In this notebook, we turn our attention to **Regression**. The objective is to use python and jupyter notebooks to tackle The Red Wine dataset. The aim is to ***use exploratory data analysis (EDA) and linear regression to predict alcohol levels in wine with a model that's as accurate as possible***. 

We'll try a *univariate* analysis (one involving a single explanatory variable) as well as a *multivariate* one (involving multiple explanatory variables), and we'll iterate together towards a decent model by the end of the notebook.

For this notebook, we're going to use the red wine dataset, wineQualityReds.csv. Make sure it's downloaded and sitting in your working directory. This is a very common dataset for practicing regression analysis and is actually freely available on Kaggle, [here](https://www.kaggle.com/piyushgoyal443/red-wine-dataset).

This project will have the following structure: 

**1. Sourcing and loading** 
**2. Cleaning, transforming, and visualizing**
**3. Modeling**
**4. Evaluating and concluding**
